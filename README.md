# A data visualization of the Drake-Kendrick beef ðŸ¥©

Still WIP, experimenting with the [MUI X Charts Library](https://mui.com/x/react-charts/getting-started/). 

Makes use of the public API mentioned in [sp-playcount-librespot](https://github.com/entriphy/sp-playcount-librespot?tab=readme-ov-file) repo, which was created for educational purposes only.

The Spotify API does not publicize playcounts for whatever reason and so we have to pull playcount data from that API to compare against.

Also missing The Heart Part 6 and Taylor Made Freestyle because they're not hosted by Drake on Spotify.

# Installation
